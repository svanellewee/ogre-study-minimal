==================

Minimilist Ogre example

Note 1: After cloning, make a brand new folder and call cmake:

cmake ../directory_where_cloned_repo_lives

This should then create for you a makefile etc you can run. Then remember to copy cfg files to the right folders.

Note 2: The resources makes reference to SDKTray. I think that can be commented out for now...
